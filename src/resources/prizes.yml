        We challenge you to transform research communication.
        
        Are you interested in the benefit that open access, open science and open data could bring to the world? The way that scientific research is shared
        and evaluated still bears the legacy of a system based around print media. New technologies in the digital era present a huge opportunity to accelerate
        discovery and make science collaborative instead of competitive. Will you help us to transform biology with technology?
      prize: Raspberry Pi Model 3 with 16GB SD card, plus the GrovePi+ Starter Kit with an array of sensors for creating your own IoT device.

      description: |
        Artificial intelligence isn't just for processing requests and synthesizing data anymore. Now, technology such as Cognitive Services allow developers
        to understand sentiment, a trend known as affective computing. The idea is, that by understanding emotions, artificially intelligent technology could
        predict a person's needs in drastically more human ways.
        
        So can you use facial expressions to determine how much user is engaged with your content or even greet them with a smile? The challenge - develop a
        solution that Relies on the Cognitive Services or Microsoft Bot Framework and has at least one of the following
        
        - Use emotion detection to provide a new means of interaction with the user of the application.
        - Solve or improve a real-world problem.
        - Incorporate the use of a cameras (whether in phones, robots using Kinect, Realsense or Laptop/Mobile inbuilt Camera).

        We challenge you to connect a speech-to-text engine to a LSTM machine learning network to a text-to-speech engine. Users can then speak to the
        device for a while (or select a personality trained from a pre-existing corpus of text). Then I can say half a sentence and allow the “Sentence
        Finisher” to predict and say the rest. We'll bring along some Amazon Echo Dots to provide the voice I/O and our engineers will be pitching in to
        help teams who want to explore and create some interesting examples in this area. [See here](http://www.argondesign.com/news/2017/jan/11/hack-cambridge-2017/)
