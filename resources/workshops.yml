  - name: Cantab on FinTech
    description: |
      Finance has been a Big Data arena for decades, long before the term FinTech was coined. We will review the opportunities for programmers
      in hedge funds and investment banks. As time permits, we will drill down on interesting implementation details involving time series data.
      There will be some visualisations of how one trades billions of dollars a day, and how one copes with millisecond updates to the data that
      feeds ‘black box’ trading models.
