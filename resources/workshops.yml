  - name: Cantab on FinTech
    description: |
      Finance has been a Big Data arena for decades, long before the term FinTech was coined. We will review the opportunities for programmers
      in hedge funds and investment banks. As time permits, we will drill down on interesting implementation details involving time series data.
      There will be some visualisations of how one trades billions of dollars a day, and how one copes with millisecond updates to the data that
      feeds ‘black box’ trading models.

  - name: Metaswitch on Communicating in the Cloud
    description: |
      Global communications networks are undergoing fundamental change.  Historically built on specialised, dedicated hardware, today’s
      communication services are delivered on standard commodity computing hardware … with all the intelligence delivered in software. 
     
      This technology revolution is enabling dramatically faster innovation and has created startling potential for new services to capture 10s
      or 100s of millions of users rapidly.
      
      We will analyse the key technological changes that are driving this revolution, illustrate some of the complex programming challenges
      that arise, and discuss the opportunities for software developers in this domain.
