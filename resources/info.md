## Getting to the Corn Exchange

By now you should know how you're getting to Cambridge be it by train, coach, car or horse.
The Cambridge Corn exchange is about a 20 minute walk from the train station, following signs
to the city centre/Grand Arcade will get you most of the way there. There are some options for
parking near the venue, which you can find on the Corn Exchange website. We have a [map](#map)
just below on this page which will give a little more context.
