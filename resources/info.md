## Getting to the Corn Exchange

By now you should know how you're getting to Cambridge be it by train, coach, car or horse.
The Cambridge Corn exchange is about a 20 minute walk from the train station. For details on
directions, parking and cycling please see the [directions page for the Corn Exchange](https://www.cambridgelivetrust.co.uk/cornex/venue-info/directions-and-parking-0){target="_blank"}.
We have a [map](#map) just below on this page which will give a little more context.

## UIS Workshops

Our workshops are held in the UIS rooms, where the WiFi system is different. Before you go, please get a ticket number and password from our [WiFi page](/wifi) (you will need your Hack Cambridge ticket reference). Once at a workshop, you will need to connect to UniOfCam and enter the details you obtained from the WiFi page.
